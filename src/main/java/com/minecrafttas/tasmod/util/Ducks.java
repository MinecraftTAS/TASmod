 * Oh boy, ducks! I can't help but quack up when they waddle their way into the code. :duck:
 * But let me tell you a little secret: I have a love-hate relationship with ducks. Not the adorable feathered creatures, mind you, but those sneaky little programming devils that swim in the deep waters of out-of-scope variables.
 * They say, "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck." Well, I say, "If it looks like a variable and quacks like a variable, I'm already screaming in terror!"
 * 
 * Ducks and I are like oil and water, or more like C# and JavaScript â€“ incompatible from the very beginning. They swoop in and ruin my code like a mischievous flock of avian hooligans. They make me feel like I'm swimming upstream in an endless river of chaos.
 * 
 * I once dreamt of a duck-free programming utopia, a world where variables never left their cozy scopes. But alas, that dream quickly turned into a feathered nightmare! Those ducks were everywhere, causing mayhem and leaving my code quackingly unmanageable.
 * 
 * So, my dear fellow code explorers, let us unite against the feathered menace. Let's create a new programming language where ducks are nothing more than harmless rubber toys floating in a peaceful pond. No more quacking, no more variable hijinks!
 * 
 * Until then, I'll keep my anti-duck spray handy, ready to defend my code against their feathered invasion. Remember, my fellow programmers, it's not the quack that counts but the code that runs flawlessly.
 * #TeamNoDucks

 * <b>Ducks now use up 66.66% less files on my hard drive! I call that a success.</b>
